# Welcome to the MeteoGate Documentation

**MeteoGate is a ‘One-Stop Shop’ for discovering and accessing meteorological and hydrological data across Europe, priovided by [EUMETNET](https://www.eumetnet.eu/).**
  
It enables National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) to share data openly while retaining full control and ownership. Through a common technical and policy framework, MeteoGate supports both public data access and obligations under EU legislation and the WMO WIS 2.0 initiative.

MeteoGate makes open meteorological and hydrological data freely accessible to all. **Anyone—researchers, developers, institutions, or the general public—can use the data provided through MeteoGate.** Some datasets may require registration, but high-value datasets (HVDs) are accessible without barriers.

## Who Should Use This?

This guide is designed for:

  - **Data Consumers:** Users accessing public data through open APIs  
  - **Data Publishers** NMHSs contributing data and metadata  
  - **Community Capability Operators** NMHSs operating shared MeteoGate platform components.
