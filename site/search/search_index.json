A centre-id is proposed by the provider of the MeteoGate Data Supply service and endorsed by the WMO Secretariat. It is a single identifier consisting of a top-level domain (TLD) and a centre name and represents the data publisher, distributor or issuing centre of a given dataset or data product/granule (see the Manual on WIS, Volume II \u2013 Appendix D. WIS2 Topic Hierarchy).  </p> <p>For example, uk-metoffice-nmc would represent the National Meteorological Centre (NMC) operated by Met Office, the United Kingdom\u2019s National Meteorological service.  When providing a Data Supply service on behalf of a EUMETNET Programme (HVD Service), a new center_id can be registered which may include all underlying topics without having to move or change anything.  </p> <p>The centre-id should follow a similar pattern: [country id]-[met center name] + the descriptor \u2018eumetnet\u2019   </p> <p>Following the above example, the centre-id for the UK NMC supplying data via an EUMETNET HVD service would then be uk-metoffice-eumetnet This way searching for topics in all *.eumetnet centers will give the same result. </p> <p>Complex Data Supply services using multiple message brokers may require more than one centre-id to be registered. In such cases, please get in touch with the MeteoGate Service Desk or the WIS NFP for more guidance. </p> <p>For more information, please refer to the WIS2 Guide, section 2.6.1.2 Guidance on assigning a centre identifier for a WIS2 Node. </p>"},{"location":"3-publishing-data/#assessing-and-accepting-the-wis2-node","title":"Assessing and accepting the WIS2 Node","text":"<p>WMO designates Global Information System Centres (GISC) to coordinate and manage data sharing within WIS2.
