Developed and operated by EUMETNET, MeteoGate lets European National Meteorological Services openly share their hydrological and meteorological data and information.  </p> <p></p> <p>MeteoGate Data Explorer lets users discover data through search, browse and preview functionalities. It provides URLs for setting up routine access to data as well as for subscribing to data updates from the WIS 2.0 Global Broker.</p> <p>MeteoGate API Gateway for data access is made up of two key parts:</p> <ul> <li>API Management provides the interface between data consumers and local data stores. Once checks are completed it passes valid requests to Members.</li> <li>Identity &amp; Access Manager carries out checks, making sure that access policies are being followed and quality of service maintained.</li> </ul> <p>Currently, there is an API Gateway running on the European Weather Cloud. In the future, additional instances can be offered from public cloud platforms, if required.</p> <p>The Data Supply (also called WIS 2 Node) is a local component operated by each National Meteorological and Hydrological Service (NMHS) or as a centralised service (for High-Value Datasets). It is responsible for exposing data, managing metadata, and publishing notifications in line with WIS 2.0 requirements. Data Supply components:</p> <ul> <li>Serve data collections via standard APIs (e.g. OGC API - EDR),</li> <li>Generate and publish discovery metadata and provenance metadata,</li> <li>Send update notifications via a Local Broker to the WIS 2.0 Global Broker.</li> </ul> <p>In MeteoGate, there are two main types of Data Supply components.

Each of the activities is subsequently discussed.</p> <p></p> <p>i.  Create Data: In its operations, the Data Owner creates or updates data (for example, observations from automated weather stations or weather model data) in its applications.</p> <p>ii. Publish data: The Data Publisher:</p> <ul> <li>Collects the data (manually or automatically) and publishes it on its Data Supply component either<ul> <li>as an addition to an existing dataset, for example, one update cycle worth of new data added to a dataset consisting of weather observations; or,</li> <li>if the shared data forms a completely new dataset, one is created. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Updates the Collection-level metadata if required.<ul> <li>Creates or updates the Resource-level metadata.</li> <li>Manually updates the Discovery metadata on the Data Supply referring to the new or updated data, if required. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Note: Discovery metadata does not change often. It may change, for example, if there is a fundamental change in the scope of the shared data, or a change in Data Publisher information or data licensing. New discovery metadata also needs to be created for completely new datasets.</p> <p>iii.    Publish notification: The Local Capability Operator publishes a notification to advertise the new discovery metadata and/or data.</p> <p>iv. WMO re-publishes notification: The WMO WIS 2.0 Global Broker subscribes to notifications from the Data Supply. It then re-publishes notifications about the new data and metadata to all applications which have subscribed to them.</p> <p>v.  Update WMO catalogue: The WMO WIS 2.0 Global Discovery Catalogue subscribes to notifications from the Global Broker and thus gets notified of new and updated discovery metadata. When it gets notified about such a change, the Global Discovery Catalogue fetches the updated discovery metadata and updates the catalogue accordingly.</p> <p>vi. Find data: Data Consumers can be made aware about available data in various ways. They can:</p> <ul> <li>Subscribe to notifications from the Global Broker and be notified about updated metadata and data.</li> <li>Find the datasets that meet their needs using the Data Explorer by browsing or searching for datasets with specific characteristics. </li> <li>Search and browse the WMO\u2019s Global Discovery Catalogue, in cases where a summary of the available datasets is sufficient.</li> <li>Search via common search engines \u2013 records in the WMO Global Discovery Catalogue are indexed by the search engines enabling data consumers to find them via their favourite/normal search path.</li> </ul> <p>vii.    Request data: Using information provided in the discovery metadata, the Data Consumer can:</p> <ul> <li>Make anonymous requests for shared data through the API Gateway. </li> <li>When required by a data policy and in line with EU regulation, the API Gateway requires authentication from the user using an API Key. A Data Consumer can obtain an API Key by registering to MeteoGate using a trusted Third-Party Identity Provider.</li> </ul> <p>viii.   Proxied access: The API Gateway proxies access to connected Data Supply services.

For local identifier, use an unique name.</p> <p>For example, the Met Office synoptic discovery metadata has the following id: <code>\"id\": \"urn:wmo:md:uk-metoffice:weather.surface-based-observations.synop.uk_synop\"</code></p> <p>Properties</p> <p>The <code>properties</code> object contains the core descriptive metadata for a dataset. These properties provide essential information that enables discovery, filtering, governance, and correct interpretation of the data in MeteoGate, WIS 2.0 Global Discovery Catalogue, and downstream systems.</p> <p>All discovery metadata records must include the required properties defined by the WMO Core Metadata Profile (WCMP) Version 2. Additional optional properties may be included where relevant. A complete and authoritative list is available in the WMO Core Metadata Profile (WCMP) Version 2.</p> <p>Required Properties:</p> <p>The following properties are required for all dataset-level discovery metadata records:</p> <ul> <li><code>type</code>: Describes the resource type described by the WCMP record. Example: <code>\"type\": \"Dataset\"</code> </li> <li><code>title</code>: A human-readable name of the dataset. Example: <code>\"title\": \"Land surface weather observations\"</code> </li> <li><code>description</code>: A free-text summary description of the dataset. Example: <code>\"description\":\"Land surface observations measured at automatic and manual weather stations of EUMETNET Members and their trusted partners (last 24 hours only)\"</code> </li> <li><code>themes</code>: The <code>themes</code> field provides a high-level thematic classification of the dataset, supporting browsing and filtering in discovery services. In WCMP2, themes are expressed as lists of concepts referenced to a controlled vocabulary or knowledge organisation system.  </li> </ul> <p>Themes should be chosen from well-defined and authoritative vocabularies, such as the WIS 2.0 earth-system discipline codes.  </p> <p>For a detailed explanation of how themes, concepts, and parameters are used together, see the section Themes, Concepts and Parameters below.  </p> <p>Example:  </p> <pre><code>\"themes\": [\n  {\n    \"id\": \"weather\",\n    \"title\": \"Weather\",\n    \"scheme\": \"https://codes.wmo.int/wis/topic-hierarchy/earth-system-discipline\"\n  }\n]\n</code></pre> <ul> <li><code>geometry</code>: Describes the geospatial extent of the dataset using GeoJSON geometry. This allows users to discover datasets based on spatial coverage. Example:  </li> </ul> <pre><code>\"geometry\": {\n  \"type\": \"Polygon\",\n  \"coordinates\": [\n    [\n      [-70, 10],\n      [40, 10],\n      [40, 90],\n      [-70, 90],\n      [-70, 10]\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li><code>time</code>: Describes the temporal extent of the dataset. It may also include a resolution field to indicate how frequently new data or notifications are published. Example:  </li> </ul> <pre><code>\"time\": {\n  \"interval\": [\n    \"T00Z\",\n    \"T23Z\"\n  ],\n  \"resolution\": \"PT10M\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p><code>interval</code> defines the temporal coverage. <code>resolution</code> uses ISO 8601 duration format (e.g. PT10M, PT1H).   - <code>contacts</code>: Provides contact information for the dataset, enabling users to request support, report issues, or seek clarification. Contacts should include at least one responsible organisation or role. If the API is proxied through the MeteoGate Gateway, include contact details for the MeteoGate service desk in addition to contact details for your organisation.   - <code>keywords</code>: Include <code>\"meteogate\"</code> to tag datasets as part of the MeteoGate system. Additional keywords may also be provided (optional).   - <code>licence</code>: Include the licence under which the dataset is made available. Example: <code>\"licence\": \"CC BY 4.0\"</code>.   - <code>links</code>: Links provide access to the data, documentation, licences, and related resources, including e.g. canonical data access URLs, API endpoints, human-readable documentation, and licence information.  </p> <p>Ensure links in metadata point to your authoritative endpoints \u2014 not to URLs created by the API Gateway. Include a <code>rel=\"canonical\"</code> link pointing to the resolvable URL of the dataset.  </p> <p>Include a link to API docs (e.g., the Swagger docs for the API). This link should include: <code>\u201crel\u201d=\u201dservice-doc\u201d</code> and <code>\u201ctype\u201d=\u201dtext/html\u201d</code>. For example:  </p> <pre><code>{\n  \"rel\": \"service-doc\",\n  \"type\": \"text/html\",\n  \"href\": \"https://api.example.org/docs\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Conditionally Required / Strongly Recommended Properties:</p> <ul> <li><code>wmo:dataPolicy</code>: Specifies whether the dataset is classified as <code>core</code> or <code>recommended</code>, in accordance with the WMO Unified Data Policy, Resolution 1 (Cg-Ext(2021)). Note that core data must be open access and recommended data may be open or access-controlled. This classification is independent of access control. Example: <code>\"wmo:dataPolicy\": \"recommended\"</code></li> <li><code>created</code>: Indicates when the metadata record was created. Example:<code>\"created\": \"2025-06-04T14:00:00Z\"</code></li> </ul> <p>Optional Properties:</p> <p>These properties are optional according to WCMP2, but are strongly recommended for MeteoGate datasets.</p> <ul> <li><code>language</code>: Language of the metadata, e.g. <code>\"language\":\"en\"</code>.</li> <li><code>updated</code>: Indicate when the metadata record was created and last updated. Example:<code>\"updated\": \"2025-06-04T14:00:00Z\"</code></li> <li><code>rights</code>: A human-readable statement describing usage rights not fully covered by the licence. Example: <code>\"rights\": \"Users are granted free and unrestricted access to this data, without charge and with no conditions on use. Users are requested to attribute the producer of this data. WMO Unified Data Policy (Resolution 1 (Cg-Ext 2021))\"</code></li> <li><code>version</code>: Specifies the version or edition of the dataset, where applicable. Example: <code>\"version\": \"1.0\"</code></li> <li><code>status</code>: Describes the operational status of the dataset (e.g. operational, experimental).</li> <li><code>linkTemplates</code>: Used for templated or parameterised access (e.g. dynamic API queries).</li> </ul> <p>Additional Properties:</p> <p>The <code>properties</code> object may include additional fields as needed, provided they do not conflict with WCMP2. These can be used to, for example, support filtering and discovery, provide domain-specific information, and expose identifiers or references relevant to the dataset.</p> <p>Themes, Concepts and Parameters</p> <p>In WCMP2, semantic classification of datasets is expressed using the <code>themes</code> property. A theme represents a grouping of one or more <code>concepts</code> that are taken from a controlled vocabulary or knowledge organisation system.</p> <p>Themes are used to describe both high-level classifications (such as scientific domain or observation type) and dataset parameters (such as physical variables). In this context, parameters are expressed as concepts using recognised parameter vocabularies.</p> <p>Together, themes and concepts help users, discovery services, and automated systems understand what the data represents.</p> <p>Structure of a Theme (Concept Block):</p> <p>Each theme consists of:   - a list of one or more <code>concepts</code>   - a <code>scheme</code> that defines the vocabulary used  </p> <p>Each concept typically includes:   - <code>id</code>: a short identifier   - <code>title</code>: a human-readable label   - <code>url</code>: a link to the authoritative definition  </p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>\"themes\": [  \n{  \n  \"concepts\": [  \n    {  \n      \"id\": \"weather\",  \n      \"title\": \"Weather\",  \n      \"url\": \"https://codes.wmo.int/wis/topic-hierarchy/earth-system-discipline/weather\"  \n    }  \n  ],  \n  \"scheme\": \"https://codes.wmo.int/wis/topic-hierarchy/earth-system-discipline\"  \n}  \n</code></pre> <p>Discovery metadata can include multiple themes to describe different aspects of a dataset, such as its scientific domain, observation type, and physical parameters.</p> <p>Domain and Discipline Concepts (WIS 2.0):</p> <p>Concepts can be used to describe the scientific domain and data category, aligned with the WIS 2.0 Topic Hierarchy. Using concepts allows consistent discovery across different datasets and publishers, filtering and grouping in MeteoGate Data Explorer, correct interpretation by external catalogues and AI tools, and alignment with WMO and international standards.</p> <p>Concepts are not data values or API query parameters. Instead, they describe the scientific domain of the dataset, the type of observations or products, and the physical parameters included in the data. </p> <p>Concepts can also describe the observation category, such as surface-based observations:</p> <pre><code>{  \n  \"concepts\": [  \n    {  \n      \"id\": \"surface-based-observations\"  \n    }  \n  ],  \n  \"scheme\": \"https://codes.wmo.int/wis/topic-hierarchy/earth-system-discipline/weather\"  \n}  \n</code></pre> <p>Parameter Concepts (Physical Variables):</p> <p>Physical parameters included in the dataset should be described using a recognised vocabulary, such as NERC standard names.</p> <p>Example:  </p> <pre><code>{  \n  \"concepts\": [  \n    {  \n      \"id\": \"air_temperature\",  \n      \"title\": \"Air temperature\",  \n      \"url\": \"http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/standard_name/air_temperature/\"  \n    },  \n    {  \n      \"id\": \"wind_speed\",  \n      \"title\": \"Wind speed\",  \n      \"url\": \"http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/standard_name/wind_speed/\"  \n    },  \n    {  \n      \"id\": \"wind_to_direction\",  \n      \"title\": \"Wind direction\",  \n      \"url\": \"http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/standard_name/wind_to_direction/\"  \n    }  \n  ],  \n  \"scheme\": \"https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/standard_name\"  \n}  \n</code></pre> <p>These concepts indicate which physical quantities are available somewhere in the dataset, not how to query them.</p> <p>Best Practices:   - Use well-known, authoritative vocabularies wherever possible.   - Include only concepts that genuinely apply to the dataset.   - Keep concepts stable over time to support long-term discovery.   - Avoid duplicating information already expressed in the topic hierarchy unless it adds semantic clarity.</p> <p>Access Control</p> <p>If access control (e.g. API key) is required, describe it using the <code>security</code> block.</p> <p>Follow the instructions in WIS2 Cookbook recipe 3.2. Publishing a WIS2 Notification Message with access control to describe the type of access control used.</p> <p>Example for data using API Key for access control:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"rel\": \"items\",  \n  \"type\": \"application/vnd.coverage+json\",  \n  \"href\": \"https://api.example.org/edr/v1/collections/observations\",  \n  \"security\": {  \n    \"default\": {  \n      \"type\": \"apiKey\",  \n      \"name\": \"AUTHORIZATION\",  \n      \"in\": \"header\",  \n      \"description\": \"Request API key at https://developer.example.org\"  \n    }  \n  }  \n}  \n</code></pre> <p>Validation</p> <p>Validate discovery metadata using the PYWCMP tool provided by WMO: see WIS2 Cookbook recipe 3.7.

Apply stricter rate limiting for public cloud data and educate users on responsible API usage, including cost and CO2 impacts. </li> <li>Secure APIs appropriately. Implement API rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse, DDoS attacks, and excessive traffic that could impact service availability. Use HTTPS for all API endpoints. Enforce input validation and sanitisation to mitigate injection attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS). If local authentication is required, use strong authentication and authorisation methods such as API keys, OAuth 2.0, or JWT tokens. </li> <li>Ensure versioning and backward compatibility to prevent disruptions for users. Use URL-based versioning (e.g., /v1/resource) to prevent breaking changes. Follow semantic versioning (major.minor.patch), support multiple active versions during transitions, and clearly document deprecations with headers (Deprecation, Sunset). Maintain backward compatibility by making additive changes when possible. </li> <li>Enable structured logging and monitoring to track API usage and diagnose issues efficiently. </li> <li>Provide documentation. Create OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation for discoverability and self-describing endpoints.

Discovery metadata needs to be published so that it\u2019s openly accessible (no access controls). Discovery metadata should be re-published daily (i.e., every 24-hours) even if there are no changes. This helps ensure that the discovery metadata in the Global Discovery Catalogue stays fresh.</li> <li>Publishing discovery metadata uses the same mechanisms in WIS2 used for telling users about new data: real-time notifications via MQTT.

The API Gateway also collects data on transactions to provide data usage and publishing information through the Insights Service. API Gateways handle data requests from Data Consumer applications, provide cybersecurity and access control, and proxy access to connected Data Supply services. The API Gateway may need to authenticate users accessing some datasets, as stated in the data policy. The API Gateway uses unique tokens (API Keys) appended to data access requests to identify users. Users must register in the MeteoGate Developer Portal to obtain an API Key.</p> <p>The API Gateway is a MeteoGate managed service. Data Publishers can choose to register their Data Supply components with the appropriate API Gateway, based on how they have deployed/configured their service, service proximity to the API Gateway, anticipated data volumes, estimated costs, and whether they want to capture metrics or benefit from other capabilities such as rate-limiting and access control.</p> <p>Selecting the deployment platforms is an architectural decision for MeteoGate, impacted by e.g. where most of the Data Supply services are hosted, and cost matters. API Gateway is currently deployed on EWC as 80 % of EUMETNET Members either do not need API Gateway protection or can be covered by the MeteoGate API Gateway on EWC. Even though the API Gateway instances are federated, the Data Consumer can use the same API Key at every API Gateway instance.
