MeteoGate provides technical infrastructure, underpinned by policies, standards, and processes, which enable data to be discovered and accessed in one place.

Developed and operated by EUMETNET, MeteoGate lets European National Meteorological Services openly share their hydrological and meteorological data and information.  </p> <p></p> <p>MeteoGate Data Explorer lets users discover data through search, browse and preview functionalities. It provides URLs for setting up routine access to data as well as for subscribing to data updates from the WIS 2.0 Global Broker.</p> <p>MeteoGate API Gateway for data access is made up of two key parts:</p> <ul> <li>API Management provides the interface between data consumers and local data stores. Once checks are completed it passes valid requests to Members.</li> <li>Identity &amp; Access Manager carries out checks, making sure that access policies are being followed and quality of service maintained.</li> </ul> <p>Currently, there is an API Gateway running on the European Weather Cloud. In the future, additional instances can be offered from public cloud platforms, if required.</p> <p>The Data Supply (also called WIS 2 Node) is a local component operated by each National Meteorological and Hydrological Service (NMHS) or as a centralised service (for High-Value Datasets). It is responsible for exposing data, managing metadata, and publishing notifications in line with WIS 2.0 requirements. Data Supply components:</p> <ul> <li>Serve data collections via standard APIs (e.g. OGC API - EDR),</li> <li>Generate and publish discovery metadata and provenance metadata,</li> <li>Send update notifications via a Local Broker to the WIS 2.0 Global Broker.</li> </ul> <p>In MeteoGate, there are two main types of Data Supply components. The first are centrally operated HVD Services, which provide access to EU High-Value Datasets such as E-SOH (land-based surface observations), radar data, and climate datasets. The second type consists of locally maintained Data Supplies operated by (NMHSs).</p> <p>In addition, the Insights Service provides shared monitoring and analytics capabilities across the system. It collects usage statistics, performance metrics, and operational health data from core components such as the API Gateway.</p> <p>MeteoGate builds on the following WMO WIS 2.0 components:</p> <ul> <li>Global Discovery Catalogue lists and describes data assets and data collections, indexed, linked, and searchable to support data discovery and usage.

Each of the activities is subsequently discussed.</p> <p></p> <p>i.  Create Data: In its operations, the Data Owner creates or updates data (for example, observations from automated weather stations or weather model data) in its applications.</p> <p>ii. Publish data: The Data Publisher:</p> <ul> <li>Collects the data (manually or automatically) and publishes it on its Data Supply component either<ul> <li>as an addition to an existing dataset, for example, one update cycle worth of new data added to a dataset consisting of weather observations; or,</li> <li>if the shared data forms a completely new dataset, one is created. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Updates the Collection-level metadata if required.<ul> <li>Creates or updates the Resource-level metadata.</li> <li>Manually updates the Discovery metadata on the Data Supply referring to the new or updated data, if required. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Note: Discovery metadata does not change often. It may change, for example, if there is a fundamental change in the scope of the shared data, or a change in Data Publisher information or data licensing. New discovery metadata also needs to be created for completely new datasets.</p> <p>iii.    Publish notification: The Local Capability Operator publishes a notification to advertise the new discovery metadata and/or data.</p> <p>iv. WMO re-publishes notification: The WMO WIS 2.0 Global Broker subscribes to notifications from the Data Supply. It then re-publishes notifications about the new data and metadata to all applications which have subscribed to them.</p> <p>v.  Update WMO catalogue: The WMO WIS 2.0 Global Discovery Catalogue subscribes to notifications from the Global Broker and thus gets notified of new and updated discovery metadata. When it gets notified about such a change, the Global Discovery Catalogue fetches the updated discovery metadata and updates the catalogue accordingly.</p> <p>vi. Find data: Data Consumers can be made aware about available data in various ways. They can:</p> <ul> <li>Subscribe to notifications from the Global Broker and be notified about updated metadata and data.</li> <li>Find the datasets that meet their needs using the Data Explorer by browsing or searching for datasets with specific characteristics. </li> <li>Search and browse the WMO\u2019s Global Discovery Catalogue, in cases where a summary of the available datasets is sufficient.</li> <li>Search via common search engines \u2013 records in the WMO Global Discovery Catalogue are indexed by the search engines enabling data consumers to find them via their favourite/normal search path.</li> </ul> <p>vii.    Request data: Using information provided in the discovery metadata, the Data Consumer can:</p> <ul> <li>Make anonymous requests for shared data through the API Gateway. </li> <li>When required by a data policy and in line with EU regulation, the API Gateway requires authentication from the user using an API Key. A Data Consumer can obtain an API Key by registering to MeteoGate using a trusted Third-Party Identity Provider. </li> <li>Bulk download data. </li> </ul> <p>viii.   Proxied access: The API Gateway proxies access to connected Data Supply services. The user can then utilise the data in their own applications. </p> <p>[!NOTE] Using the API Gateway is optional for the Data Publisher. They can also publish the data directly from the Data Supply (for example, if the dataset is very large or if the Data Publisher already has API Management implemented as part of their Data Supply capability).</p> <p>ix.

Use caching (Redis, CDNs) to reduce load, optimise database indexing for spatiotemporal data, and enable byte-range access (GRIB, COG) for efficient retrieval. Store large datasets in chunked formats (Zarr), process long-running queries asynchronously, and leverage cloud storage (S3, Azure) for auto-scaling. Apply stricter rate limiting for public cloud data and educate users on responsible API usage, including cost and CO2 impacts. </li> <li>Secure APIs appropriately. Implement API rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse, DDoS attacks, and excessive traffic that could impact service availability. Use HTTPS for all API endpoints. Enforce input validation and sanitisation to mitigate injection attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS). If local authentication is required, use strong authentication and authorisation methods such as API keys, OAuth 2.0, or JWT tokens. </li> <li>Ensure versioning and backward compatibility to prevent disruptions for users. Use URL-based versioning (e.g., /v1/resource) to prevent breaking changes. Follow semantic versioning (major.minor.patch), support multiple active versions during transitions, and clearly document deprecations with headers (Deprecation, Sunset). Maintain backward compatibility by making additive changes when possible. </li> <li>Enable structured logging and monitoring to track API usage and diagnose issues efficiently. </li> <li>Provide documentation. Create OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation for discoverability and self-describing endpoints.
