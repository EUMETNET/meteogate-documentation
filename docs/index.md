# Welcome to the MeteoGate Documentation

**MeteoGate is a ‘One-Stop Shop’ for discovering and accessing meteorological and hydrological data across Europe.**
  
It enables National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) to share data openly while retaining full control and ownership. Through a common technical and policy framework, MeteoGate supports both public data access and obligations under EU legislation and the WMO WIS 2.0 initiative. MeteoGate is run by [EUMETNET](https://www.eumetnet.eu/).

MeteoGate makes open meteorological and hydrological data freely accessible to all. **Anyone – researchers, developers, institutions, or the general public – can use the data provided through MeteoGate.** Some datasets may require registration, but high-value datasets (HVDs) are accessible without barriers.

## Who Should Use This?

This guide is designed for:

  - **Data Consumers:** Users accessing public data through open APIs  
  - **Data Publishers** NMHSs contributing data and metadata  
  - **Community Capability Operators** NMHSs operating shared MeteoGate platform components.
