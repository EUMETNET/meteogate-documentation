## Policies relating to MeteoGate development and use

The approach for MeteoGate is to use appropriate policies and standards which are already established, only creating new ones where necessary. For example, existing EUMETNET governance patterns and structures will be used where available. In addition, there are several MeteoGate-specific policies and guiding documentation.

The following MeteoGate documents are available:

  - **[Terms of Use]()**: Terms and conditions MeteoGate users must approve to access data through MeteoGate.
  - **[Privacy Policy]()**: Ensures that MeteoGate users’ data is handled in compliance with GDPR.
  - **[Data Governance Policy]()**: Top-level policy to ensure that the data shared through MeteoGate is consistent, trustworthy, and not misused. It guides data publishing and consumption practices.
  - **[Cyber Security Policy]()**: Outlines EUMETNET’s approach to protecting MeteoGate, its technology assets, and data.
  - **[Participation Management Policy]()**: Management approach for each category of MeteoGate stakeholders (Data Publishers, Data Consumers, Community Capability Operators).
  - **[Incident and Problem Management Policy]()**: Approach for managing incidents and problems across MeteoGate by the Solution Manager and Community Capability Operators.
  - **[MeteoGate Manual]()** (this document): Comprehensive guidance on how to access, share, and operate with MeteoGate, including implementation of policies.
  - **[Quality of Service]()**: Defines the quality criteria for the MeteoGate service, Community Components, and relevant Local Components.
  - **[EUMETNET FEMDI Programme Decision]()**: The official agreement for MeteoGate operation and maintenance, covering governance, reporting, budgeting, legal matters, and termination.
